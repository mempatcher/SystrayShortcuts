# Systray Shortcuts

With the transition from Windows 10 to Windows 11, the ability to add custom toolbars to the taskbar was removed. This was a feature that many users appreciated, as it made it easy to quickly access folders, programs or shortcuts directly from the taskbar.

Systray Shortcuts is created as a solution to this removed functionality. It allows you to add your own shortcuts to the system tray (systray) – the area in the lower right corner by the clock – giving the user a quick and easy way to access their most used files, folders or programs, without having to pin them to the taskbar or use the Start menu.

## Usage
Starting the program adds an icon to the system tray. From that icon the user can add additional folders shortcuts as own customizable icons. 

Systray Shortcuts can advantageously be set as automatic startup so that it is always available and ready to use. Adding the program to the startup folder: ``Win+R -> shell:startup``. For optimal visibilty, make sure the added folders are always shown on the system tray: ``Taskbar Settings -> Other system tray icons``
